<p>In <a href="http://archive.adaic.com/tools/CKWG/Dimension/Dimension.html">
Handling Physical Dimensions in Ada</a>, there is an overview over methods
how to deal with physical dimensions in Ada:</p>

<ul>

    dimensions</li>

    GNAT method as of GPL 2013</li>
<li>SI Units Checked and Unchecked<br/>
    An outdated 2020 version of the method presented here</li>
</ul>

<p>The method presented here is an update of the last bullet above.
It uses dimensions as runtime attributes.</p>

<p>There is extensive documentation included as well as test and example
code.
This project has always been a challenge for the GNAT compiler, so there
has been a plethora of bug reports and fixes on problems encountered with respect to many years of GNAT releases.
If you use another compiler, I would be happy to hear about your findings.</p>

<h3><a name="Overview">Overview</a></h3>

<p>In <a href="http://archive.adaic.com/tools/CKWG/Dimension/Universe.html">
From The Big Bang To The Universe</a>, I have shown that Ada is not suited
to implementing physical dimensions with its type concept.
Therefore a method was presented applicable also to hard real-time systems
which gives up dimension checking within the SI units system, while keeping the
advantages of strong typing in critical cases when units from different
systems have to be mixed.
And indeed, this method has been in use in several avionics projects.</p>

<p>But the request to have full dimensional checking persists.
There are two basic ways one can try to solve the problem, either by adding
to the numeric value its dimension as an attribute, or by using different types
for different dimensions.
Since the first method is runtime and memory consuming, whereas the second one
is only compiletime-consuming, all effort naturally concentrates on the second
method.
This is doomed to fail as is shown in the paper cited above &ndash; although a
plethora of overloaded operations is used, the result is not really
satisfactory. Also see the attempt by the Ada Rapporteur Group to standardize
such a method
(<a href="http://www.ada-auth.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/ais/ai-00324.txt?rev=1.3&amp;raw=N">Ada 95 Issue 324</a>).
Physical equations with all their powers and roots evade these attempts.</p>

<p>Since Ada 2012, there has been a very clever compiler-specific method by
<a href="https://www.adacore.com/">AdaCore</a>, which handles physical
dimensions at compile-time with implementation defined aspects (see a critical
review of this method's achievements and shortcomings in my paper
<a href="http://archive.adaic.com/tools/CKWG/Dimension/Physical_units_with_GNAT_GPL_2013-AUJ35.1.pdf">
Physical units with GNAT</a>, which has appeared in <i>Ada User Journal 35.1</i>).</p>

<p>So here a different method is presented <b>to deal with physical items
in full generality</b> by adding to the value its dimension as an attribute,
i.e. the first way rejected above because of its runtime-expensiveness.
Hence this method might appear prohibitive for use in hard real-time systems.
This <b>might not be</b> the case!</p>

<table align="center" border="8" width="80%" bgcolor="#00ffff">
<tr><td align="center"><b><font color="#ff0000">By changing only the
instantiation of one package, dimensions can be switched off, leaving the
program, however big it may be, with only the pure numerics.</font></b></td></tr>
</table>

<p>The method comes in two variants, checked and unchecked, selected with
a generic parameter:</p>

<ul>
  <li><font color="#800080"><i>Checked</i></font>: Physical items carry with
      them their current dimension, so that all assignments and expressions
      are checked with respect to correct dimensions.</li>
  <li><font color="#800080"><i>Unchecked</i></font>: This variant has the
      exact same specification, but physical items only carry their numerical
      values, dimensions are stripped.</li>
</ul>

<p>Section one presents an overview of the method with its natural style to
define dimensioned items.
Dimension checking of course has runtime and storage
effects, which might be prohibitive under hard realtime conditions.
So its use is intended during software development and test phases only.
When one hundred percent code coverage during unit testing is obtained,
dimensions can safely be stripped, since dimensional correctness has then
be proved.</p>

<p>Section two shows the few differences between the checked and unchecked
variants.
It also explains how to instantiate the packages so that with only one
change in a generic signature package, the dimensions may be removed;
the code proper remains unchanged.</p>

<p>Section three presents a comparison of computation time of the checked
and unchecked variant.</p>

<p>An extensive documentation is included in the download as well as a lot
of test programs and examples of use.</p>

<h3><a name="Checked">1. Checked Variant</a></h3>

<p>A physical item is a private type</p>

<pre>  <b>type</b> Item <b>is private</b>;</pre>

<p>where the full declaration composes the item of a real value and a
dimension, where the values for the seven SI base units <i>Meter</i>,
<i>Kilogram</i>, <i>Second</i>, <i>Ampere</i>, <i>Kelvin</i>,
<i>Candela</i>, <i>Mole</i> are rational numbers representing the
exponent (e.g. m<sup>2</sup>).
We have to use rational numbers because we want to be able to represent the
most general physical equations.</p>

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%"><pre>  <b>type</b> Dimension <b>is record</b>
    m, kg, s, A, K, cd, mol: Rational;
  <b>end record</b>;

  <b>type</b> Item <b>is record</b>
    Unit : Dimension;
    Value: Real;
  <b>end record</b>;</pre></td>
<td width="50%"><i>As a side note: With a package like this, I guess a
compiler could evaluate the dimension strings in statements like
<code>v:=5.0*"m/s";</code> at compile-time and also check the correct
dimensioning during compile-time (as long as there is no text input,
see below); in effect, this would mean a new kind of optimization
could be applied to throw away the dimension components.
This would remove the necessity of the unchecked variant (see below).<br/>
(Most probably this is what
<a href="http://archive.adaic.com/tools/CKWG/Dimension/Physical_units_with_GNAT_GPL_2013-AUJ35.1.pdf">
GNAT</a> does with its unit system &ndash; note that GNAT provides only
dimensioned output, but no input.)</i></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The package Generic_SI is generic with respect to the numeric type, the type
Real above is the generic parameter name.</p>

<p>Subtypes are provided for all units defined by the SI system, for instance:</p>

<pre><span>  <b>subtype</b> Length <b>is</b> Item <font color="#0000ff"><b>with</b> Dynamic_Predicate => has_Dimension (Length, "m"),
                              Predicate_Failure => <b>raise</b> Unit_Error <b>with</b> "Length"</font>;
  <b>subtype</b> Volume <b>is</b> Item <font color="#0000ff"><b>with</b> Dynamic_Predicate => has_Dimension (Volume, "m**3"),
                              Predicate_Failure => <b>raise</b> Unit_Error <b>with</b> "Volume"</font>;
  <b>subtype</b> Speed  <b>is</b> Item <font color="#0000ff"><b>with</b> Dynamic_Predicate => has_Dimension (Speed , "m/s"),
                              Predicate_Failure => <b>raise</b> Unit_Error <b>with</b> "Speed"</font>;
  <b>subtype</b> Force  <b>is</b> Item <font color="#0000ff"><b>with</b> Dynamic_Predicate => has_Dimension (Force , "N"),
                              Predicate_Failure => <b>raise</b> Unit_Error <b>with</b> "Force"</font>;
</span></pre>

<p>Items (variables) are defined like this:</p>

<pre>  T: Time := 5.0*"s";
  X: Item;
</pre>

<p>Item T, since defined to be of subtype Time, now is constrained to any
time unit like Second or Millisecond (initial values are optional).
<font color="#00ff00">For this to be true, of course you have to make sure
that <code>pragma Assertion_Policy (Check);</code> is set.</font>
Item X is unconstrained and may assume any dimension.
This kind of declaration is recommended only for intermediate results.</p>

<p>Thus, provided that all items are dimensioned appropriately in their
declarations, expressions like free fall or force on a charged particle in
an electromagnetic field are checked for dimensional correctness - failures
will raise exceptions:</p>

<pre>  D := 0.5 * G * T**2;
  F := Q * (E + Cross (V, B));
</pre>

<p>Here, Cross is the vector cross product, and E, V, and B are dimensioned
three-dimensional vectors.</p>

<p>Of course mathematical functions like exp, log, exponentiation are also
provided; for instance:</p>

<pre>  <b>function</b> Sin (X       : Angle) <b>return</b> Dimensionless;
  <b>function</b> Sin (X, Cycle: Item ) <b>return</b> Dimensionless;
</pre>

<p>With one parameter only, the sine function requests parameter X to have
unit "rad" (an angle, a pure number, i.e. dimension 1).
With two arguments, it requests parameters X and Cycle to have the same
dimension (this is checked by a <i>Precondition</i> of sine).
Any violations will raise an exception.
The result in any case is a pure number, an item of subtype Dimensionless.
(In fact, "rad", "sr" and Dimensionless (the empty string is used "" to
indicate the latter) are the same, the symbols "rad" and
"sr" are only used to indicate that the numeric value denotes a plain or
spherical angle.)
Similar rules hold for the other trigonometric functions and their inverses.</p>
 
<p>Of course, dimensioned IO is also provided:</p>

<pre>  <b>procedure</b> Put (X   : <b>in</b> Item;
                 Fore: <b>in</b> Field  := Default_Fore;
                 Aft : <b>in</b> Field  := Default_Aft;
                 Exp : <b>in</b> Field  := Default_Exp;
                 Dim : <b>in</b> String := "");
</pre>

<p>Put for the numeric value is exactly like Ada.Text_IO.
The Dim parameter may be used to provide a prefixed unit; if it is omitted,
the unit will be output in a standard format:</p>

<pre>  V := 1.0*"m/s";          -- output as
  Put (V);                 -- 1.0*m*s**(-1)         (standard format)
  Put (V, Dim => "km/h");  -- 3.6*km/h              (note the value adaptation)
  Put (V, Dim => "s");     -- will raise exception  (wrong unit Second)
</pre>

<p>Note that there are no string quotes in the output.
The unit follows after a '*' or '/' character without space characters.
This is necessary for input or else there would be no way to see where to
stop reading, e.g. 3.6&nbsp;km vs. 3.0&nbsp;&euro;. (3.0km is deemed ugly,
and 1.0"km" is impossible in an Ada program.)</p>

<p>As you have gleaned meanwhile, any prefixed SI units may be used; please
take care of correct capitalization: "Ms" is megasecond, "mS" is millisiemens.
Case sensitivity of the SI units and prefixes is the reason why units are
given with strings.
There are two functions allowing numbers to be multiplied with unit strings:</p>

<pre>  <b>function</b> "*" (Left: Real'Base; Right: String) <b>return</b> Item;  -- 1.0*"km"
  <b>function</b> "/" (Left: Real'Base; Right: String) <b>return</b> Item;  -- 1.0/"s"
</pre>

<p>Note that the first operator is between the number and the unit string,
any others are inside the string: 1.0*"m/s", 1.0*"A/m**2"; this is incorrect:
1.0*"m"/"s" and will not compile; of course 1.0*"m"/(0.5*"s") is correct.</p>

<p>Any whole or fractional powers are allowed.</p>

<pre>  <b>function</b> "**" (Base: Item; Exponent: Rational) <b>return</b> Item;</pre>

<p>Now a word in favour of the use clause is due.
All examples you'll find in the download have been built with the
use_package_clause in action for all instances.
I can understand the reservation against the use_package_clause, but my personal
feeling is neither use-hater nor use-lover.</p>

<p>However with such basic packages like the SI packages, things are very
different.
Your whole project will be built on their instances as the very basis, so it
seems wrong to me to not use the use_package_clause mandatorily in all units
depending on them.
They in fact have the same level as package Standard (RM A.1), which is visible
everywhere by default.</p>

<p>Thus your code should look like this:</p>

<pre style='margin-left:25.45pt'><span><b>package</b> SI         <b>is new</b> Generic_SI (Float);
<b>package</b> SI.Text_IO <b>is new</b> SI.Generic_Text_IO;
... any others ...

<b>with</b> SI.Text_IO;
<font color="#009900"><b>use</b>  SI.Text_IO, SI;  -- <i>mandatory</i></font>
<b>package</b> Application <b>is</b>
  B: Magnetic_Flux_Density := 50.0 * "mT";
  ...
</span></pre>

<p>rather than without use clause</p>

<pre style='margin-left:25.45pt'><span>  B: <font color="#FF0000">SI.</font>Magnetic_Flux_Density := <font color="#FF0000">SI."*" (50.0, "mT")</font>;
</span></pre>

<p>or with only the use-type-clause
<font color="#FF0000"><code><b>use type</b> SI.Items;</code></font> in action</p>

<pre style='margin-left:25.45pt'><span>  B: <font color="#FF0000">SI.</font>Magnetic_Flux_Density := 50.0 * "mT";
</span></pre>

<h3><a name="Unchecked">2. Unchecked Variant</a></h3>

<p>The <i>unchecked</i> variant is obtained by changing an actual generic
parameter.
In fact, the package Generic_SI has as second generic parameter a dimension
signature package.</p>

<pre>  <b>generic
    type</b> Real <b>is digits</b> &lt;&gt;;
    <b>with package</b> Dimensions <b>is new</b> Dimension_Signature (&lt;&gt;);
  <b>package</b> Generic_SI <b>is</b> ...;</pre>

<p>By selecting the appropriate
<font color="#0000ff"><code>Dimensions</code></font> package
(<font color="#00ff00"><code>True_Dimensions</code></font>,
<font color="ff#0000"><code>Fake_Dimensions</code></font>),
you obtain the checked or the unchecked version.
Do not forget to set
<font color="#0000ff"><code>pragma Assertion_Policy (...);</code></font>
to the appropriate value <font color="#00ff00">Check</font> or
<font color="#ff0000">Ignore</font>.</p>

<p>Since the  type <code>Dimension</code> declared in
<code>Fake_Dimensions</code> is a null record, the behaviour is different.
Of course, in an assignment <code>D := 5.0*"km";</code> the prefix
<code>'k'</code> will be evaluated, so that the numeric value of the distance
is 5000.0; but dimensional correctness will no longer be checked in statements
as shown above in section 1 since assertions are not checked (further, the
subtype dynamic predicates are always true).
Also output will differ:</p>

<pre>  V := 1.0*"m/s";          -- output as
  Put (V);                 -- 1.0           (no unit available)
  Put (V, Dim => "km/h");  -- 3.6*km/h      (note the unit)
  Put (V, Dim => "s");     -- 1.0*s         nonsense
</pre>

<p>Here, the Dim parameter is handy &ndash; the prefix 'k' and the unit 'h'
will still be evaluated and the value adapted accordingly.
Of course the last wrong unit output cannot be prevented.
So use this variant only for production code after you have carefully
tested your code in the checked variant.</p>

<h3><a name="Measurements">3. Execution Time Measurements</a></h3>

<p>The checked version is storage consuming, fourteen integers for the
seven dimensions, one floating point number for the value.
Calculating all these numbers with each operation is time consuming.
Especially the dimension string evaluation is the most prominent time
eater, although statements like <code>T&nbsp;:=&nbsp;20.0*"s";</code>
are rare and occur mostly in initializing expressions.
Compile-time evaluation of these strings would therefore get rid of
only some part of the execution time.
Another source of unnecessary execution time could be the plethora of
functions in the generic dimension parameter packages, where the pragma
Inline most probably does not work across the package boundaries.</p>

<p>There is a program included to measure the computation time.
Roughly, the unchecked variant is about 10 times slower than the pure
numeric (only floating point) one.
So do measure your program!</p>

<p>The Schottky-Langmuir equation is used for measurements because it
includes different kinds of operations.</p>

<p>A <b>C++</b> solution (it did however not include fractional powers) with
templates was presented at
<a href="http://www.fnal.gov/docs/working-groups/fpcltf/">
http://www.fnal.gov/docs/working-groups/fpcltf/</a>.
This page has disappeared meanwhile.
The big difference to Ada's generics is that C++ templates with their
implicit instantiations allow type checking during compile-time, so that
no overhead neither in memory space nor in run-time is incurred.
In this respect, C++ templates are more powerful than Ada generics.
However at the time when the code was still there (11 February 2004),
not all C++ compilers, although capable of compiling the code, were able
to actually perform this type checking (as stated in the documentation
of the method).</p>
